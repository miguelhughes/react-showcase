## Miguel Hughes React.js Showcase

I've built a series of simplified versions of popular apps: 

- a shopping cart app
- a (slack clone)[https://miguelhughes.github.io/slack-clone/] ((view readme)[https://github.com/miguelhughes/slack-clone/tree/master])
- a (Reddit clone)[https://miguelhughes.github.io/reddit-clone/] ((view readme)[https://github.com/miguelhughes/reddit-clone/tree/master])
- a pinterest clone

Please have a look at the readme files for info on what is and isn't implemented and what's the focus of each project. I please note that these **aren't fully functional apps** (except for tic-tac-toe) but more excercises on different areas or react and/or CSS
