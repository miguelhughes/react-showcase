Each page has an [about button](https://bit.dev/miguelhughes/showcase/readme-viewer) to show what **is** and **isn't** implemented, and what's the focus of each project. I please note that these **aren't fully functional apps** but mere excercises on different areas or react and/or CSS.

The about button is also react component I built, that pulls the associated project's readme and displays it when expanded. It's imported into each project using [bit.dev](bit.dev), a cool tool that allows sharing/versioning components across different projects and with the world (similar to npm but for components)
