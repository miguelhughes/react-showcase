## Miguel Hughes React.js Showcase

I've built a series of simplified versions of popular apps: 
- a [simple shopping app](https://miguelhughes.github.io/shopping-app/) ([view readme](https://github.com/miguelhughes/shopping-app/tree/master))
- a [slack clone](https://miguelhughes.github.io/slack-clone/) ([view readme](https://github.com/miguelhughes/slack-clone/tree/master))
- a [Reddit clone](https://miguelhughes.github.io/reddit-clone/) ([view readme](https://github.com/miguelhughes/reddit-clone/tree/master))
- a time traveling [tic tac toe game](https://miguelhughes.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) ([view readme](https://github.com/miguelhughes/tic-tac-toe))

Please have a look at the readme files for info on what is and isn't implemented and what's the focus of each project. I please note that these **aren't fully functional apps** but mere excercises on different areas or react and/or CSS.
