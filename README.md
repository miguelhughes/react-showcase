Each page has an [about button](https://bit.dev/miguelhughes/showcase/readme-viewer) that expands to show the associated readme file, with info on what is and isn't implemented, and what's the focus of each project. I please note that these **aren't fully functional apps** but mere excercises on different areas or react and/or CSS.

The about button was also built by myself and exported/imported using [bit.dev](bit.dev), a cool tool that allows sharing/versioning components across different projects and with the world (similar to npm but for components)
